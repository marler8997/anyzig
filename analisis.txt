2. User Agent Detection Issues:

```javascript
if (userAgent.indexOf("MacOS") != -1) toggleOs(OS_MACOS);
```
Variable Declaration Issues:
html = ""; // Using undeclared variable
var ids = { next_id: 0 }; // Mixing var with let declarations

The 'html' variable is used without being declared (missing let/const), which could cause issues in strict mode.

4. Command Generation Logic Gap:

```javascript
if (include_curl) {
  html += generateCommandHtml(ids, "curl -L " + archive_url + " | tar xz");
}
```
The tar command is always included for both .tar.gz and .zip files, which is incorrect for Windows users. The command should be different based on archive_ext.

5. State Management Issue:

```javascript
function toggleOs(os) {
  if (current_os == os) {
    current_os = -1;
  } else {
    current_os = os;
  }
  // ...
}
```

```javascript
function copyToClipboard(text) {
  navigator.clipboard.writeText(text)
    .then(() => {
      console.log("Text copied to clipboard");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error("Could not copy text: ", err);
    });
}
```
The error is only logged to console - users get no feedback if the copy operation fails.

Pre Variable Scope Issue:
function copyCommand(id) {
  pre = get("command" + id); // Undeclared variable
  copyToClipboard(pre.innerHTML);
}

The 'pre' variable is used without being declared, which could cause issues in strict mode.


- Added proper error handling and user feedback with the new showNotification function

- Fixed OS detection by using proper user agent strings (macintosh instead of MacOS)

- Added strict mode and proper variable declarations

- Improved command generation with separate getInstallCommand function

- Added proper state management for OS/arch selection

- Added user guidance messages when no OS or arch is selected

- Added better error handling for clipboard operations

- Improved ARM64 detection

- Added null checks for DOM elements

- Removed the problematic empty alert
